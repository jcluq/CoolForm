# CoolForm

Coolform is a showcase webpage for form handling on React. 

The page generates a CV by submitting the relevant data on 3 different components. Each component manages their Data individually. 

The Education Information and Professional Information can have multiple fields which can be added dynamically. These are also added dynamically on the document. 

For the form state managing, the React-Hook-Form library was used, as it provides built tools for managing arrays of information, aswell as a simple way to do run-time validation using the Yup library. 

TypeScript is implemented to ensure type consistency in the whole app.
